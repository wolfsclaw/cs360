The goal of this app was to make an app that would be able to track items in an inventory list through the primary use of mobile devices.  To achive these goals there was a few features that the company required us to have:<BR>
<BR>
1.  A database with at least two table to store inventory item, user logins and passwords.<BR>
2.  A screen for a sign-on or sign-up for the app.<BR>
3.  A grid screen that displays all items in the inventory.<BR>
4.  A mechanism where the user can add and remove items from the inventory.<BR>
5.  A mechanism where the user can increase or decrease the number of specific items in the inventory.<BR>
6.  A mechanism to notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to zero.<BR>

The design was successful as the app worked as intended.  The look of the app was neat and uniformed and was easy to use.  I approached the coding by trying to interpret the needs of the customer and enable that with as minimal code as possible while still making the program run to their standards.  I would set up the app first in the android studio and then go in and do the coding after I had it set up.  For me, I believe the designs were successful.<BR>

I tested my code by using the debug tools to ensure that there were no errors in my code and that the code was working to industry standards.  This process is important because it catches bugs early, ensures reliability, and builds confidence in your product before release.  I had to do some research on some of the code to figure out what worked best in certain situations and how to make sure that code was inputted correctly.  This part was challenging because it was hard to figure out where to install the code to ensure that it was working correctly.<BR>

I feel, for me, designing the app was where i am the strongest.  I still struggle in some aspects of trying to write that code correctly and ensure that it is working properly.  All in all this project was fun and was challenging for me.
